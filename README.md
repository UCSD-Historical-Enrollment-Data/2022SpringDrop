# Spring 2022 Drop Data
Drop data for Spring 2022. 

Note that, since enrollment has passed, there's not really a point in having this folder aside from seeing the drop rate of certain classes.

## Supported Courses
I only have enrollment data for:
- Lower- and upper-division CSE courses.
- Lower- and upper-division COGS courses.
- Lower- and upper-division ECE courses.
- Lower- and upper-division MATH courses.

## Intervals
Starting April 9, 2022, expect a roughly **17 minute interval** between requests to the same course. This is due to the enrollment period for this quarter officially being over, and the fact that I will be tracking the three summer sessions. In general, there is now a 6 second delay between requests instead of a 3 second delay.

## Final Notes
For more information about the project, including to ask any questions, please go to the [parent repository](https://github.com/ewang2002/UCSDHistEnrollData).
